This year was quite productive for me in terms of created open source projects.

In this short post I'll to summarize what I accomplished.

## Projects

### Rust projects

All rust projects I created this year are directly or indirectly related to my open source feed reader bot - [El Monitorro](https://github.com/ayrat555/el_monitorro/):

  * [frankenstein](https://github.com/ayrat555/frankenstein) - rust client for telegram bot api.

  Initially the bot was using [telegram-bot](https://github.com/telegram-rs/telegram-bot) library. But I found many issues in this library. Moreover the library is abandoned so I was appliying bug fixes to my fork of this project.

  I decided to create a new project so I won't have to deal with spaghetti code of telegram-bot crate.

  * [fang](https://github.com/ayrat555/fang) - background job processing library for Rust

  I've been using [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) for background jobs in my bot. It worked fine for small number of jobs. But when more people started using the bot, and discovered it's  hard to manage, monitor and tune background processing in tokio. That's why I created `fang` which uses postgres db as a job queue.

  I can say that `fang` was great. Processing a couple of thousands jobs every minute and the number of jobs keeps increasing every day.

  * [cargo-mode](https://github.com/ayrat555/cargo-mode) - Emacs minor mode which allows to dynamically select cargo command

  I always try to optimize my workflow in my text editor. All my coding I do in Emacs. This small package allows to conveniently execute cargo commands from inside of Emacs.


### Note taking

This year I started using [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) for all my note taking.

  * [braindump](https://braindump.badykov.com/) - my public notes exported to hugo site

  * [cortex-dark](https://github.com/ayrat555/cortex-dark) - hugo theme used for my braindump

  * [my emacs configuration](https://github.com/ayrat555/dot-emacs) - I extended my org-roam workflow by adding new functions

### Other projects

  * [ex_pbkdf2](https://github.com/ayrat555/ex_pbkdf2/) - Rust NIf for Password-Based Key Derivation Function v2 (PBKDF2)

## Conclusion

Of course I also contributed to my existing open source projects fixing bugs and improving them. You can check them out [my github](https://github.com/ayrat555) or in my [braindump note](https://braindump.badykov.com/notes/20210830181701-my_projects/).
