At the end of each year, I write a "year in review" post where I describe the last year with hindsight.

This year was quite productive for me in terms of creating open-source projects. So this year, my post will focus on my open source projects

## Projects

### Rust projects

All rust projects I created this year are directly or indirectly related to my open-source feed reader bot - [El Monitorro](https://github.com/ayrat555/el_monitorro/):

  * [frankenstein](https://github.com/ayrat555/frankenstein) - rust client for telegram bot API.

  Initially, the bot was using [telegram-bot](https://github.com/telegram-rs/telegram-bot) library. But I found many issues in this library. Moreover, the library is abandoned so I was applying bug fixes to my fork of this project.

  I decided to create a new project so I won't have to deal with the spaghetti code of telegram-bot crate.

  You can find out more about `frankenstein` in [this blog post](https://www.badykov.com/rust/frankenstein/).

  * [fang](https://github.com/ayrat555/fang) - background job processing library for Rust

  I've been using [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) for background jobs in my bot. It worked fine for a small number of jobs. But when more people started using the bot, I discovered it's hard to manage, monitor and tune background processing in tokio. That's why I created `fang` which uses Postgres DB as a job queue.

  I can say that `fang` works great processing a couple of thousands of jobs every minute and the number of jobs keeps increasing every day.

  You can find out more about `fang` in [this blog post](https://www.badykov.com/rust/fang/).

  * [cargo-mode](https://github.com/ayrat555/cargo-mode) - Emacs minor mode which allows to dynamically select cargo command

  I always try to optimize my workflow in my text editor. All my coding I do in Emacs. This small package allows to conveniently execute cargo commands from inside of Emacs.

  You can find out more about `cargo-mode` in [this blog post](https://www.badykov.com/emacs/emacs-cargo-mode/).

### Note-taking

This year I started using [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) for all my note-taking.

  * [braindump](https://braindump.badykov.com/) - my public notes exported to hugo site

  * [cortex-dark](https://github.com/ayrat555/cortex-dark) - hugo theme used for my braindump

  * [my emacs configuration](https://github.com/ayrat555/dot-emacs) - I extended my org-roam workflow by adding new functions

  You can find out more about my `braindump` in [this blog post](https://www.badykov.com/common/braindump/).

### Other projects

  * [ex_pbkdf2](https://github.com/ayrat555/ex_pbkdf2/) - Rust NIf for Password-Based Key Derivation Function v2 (PBKDF2)

## Conclusion

Of course, I also contributed to my existing open-source projects fixing bugs and improving them. You can check them out [my github](https://github.com/ayrat555) or in my [braindump note](https://braindump.badykov.com/notes/20210830181701-my_projects/).
