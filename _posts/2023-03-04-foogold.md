Almost 1 year ago, I checked a bunch of crypto addresses generated from [naive mnemonics](/common/hack/). This time I decided to improve on this and check even more mnemonics and create a solution that can run on a server forever trying to find used mnemonics and addresses generated from them.

## Drawbacks of the previous solution

Using [the previous solution](https://github.com/ayrat555/treasure_hunter) it's possible to check mnemonics but it has a couple of drawbacks:

- Dependence on a block explorer. The main disadvantage is that to check an address, you have to make a request to a block explorer. Most block explorers have rate limits, so the checking speed is limited by these rate limits
- Programming language. Elixir is one of the best programming languages and compared to Rust, you can be much more productive with Elixir. But for low-level algorithms like hashing and cryptography used in address generation Rust is more suitable without a question.
- Ease of use. In the elixir application, all operations have to be executed in Elixir's interactive shell (iex). But for such a use case like checking mnemonics, the ideal form is a CLI app, in my opinion.

## Foolgold

So here comes `foogold` (Fool's Gold). It's a client app written in Rust that has the following features:

- Indexing of all bitcoin addresses.

Instead of relying on a block explorer, `foogold` indexes all addresses that ever participated at least in a single transaction. So basically it's a dumb blockchain explorer, that can tell you if an address was used in the bitcoin blockchain.

- Checking combinations of 1 and 2 words.

The number of mnemonics with the same word repeated the given number of times (12, 15, 18, 21 or 24) is 2048, and the number of 2-word combinations is 2048 x 2048 = 4_194_304.

The number of 3-word combinations is already 2048 x 2048 x 2048 = 8_589_934_592.  But it's still possible to check considering we just need to make a query to the local DB. But it will require a different approach compared to 1 and 2 words. Maybe using background processing with [fang](https://github.com/ayrat555/fang) will solve it. For now, it's only possible to check 1 and 2-word combinations.

- Checking random mnemonics

This feature justifies the name of the project - `foogold` (Fool's Gold). `foogold` can be run forever checking random mnemonics trying to unlock existing addresses. The probability of finding is so small that it's almost impossible.

- Checking a single a single mnemonic

- Sending notifications about found addresses to Telegram. This feature can be useful if you're running `foogold` on your server and you want to be notified about found addresses. Otherwise found addresses are just saved to a postgres table.
