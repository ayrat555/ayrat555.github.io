summary: My thoughts on the Facebook's blockchain
categories: blockchain

Less than a month a ago Facebook announced its new blockchain called Libra. A couple of days after the announcement they released a prototype written in Rust on GitHub. On the first glance it looks like Facebook is trying to catch up with the hyped technology. Let's be clear the hype around blockchains was much bigger in the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. I think the development is started at this period time.

With the amount of resources Facebook have they can work on any technology they want by hiring as many specialists in this technology's area as they can. Even looking at the number of authors of the Libra's technical paper we can see the list of more than 50 people.

I am in Ethereum community for some time.
