title: Libra: Facebook's Ethereum clone
summary: My thoughts on the Facebook's blockchain
categories: blockchain
---

Less than a month a ago Facebook announced its new blockchain called Libra. A couple of days after the announcement they released a prototype written in Rust on GitHub. On the first glance it looks like Facebook is trying to catch up with the hyped technology. Let's be clear the hype around blockchains was much bigger in the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. I think the development is started at this period of time.

With the amount of resources Facebook have they can work on any technology they want by hiring as many specialists in this technology's area as they can. Even looking at the number of authors of the Libra's technical paper we can see the list of more than 50 people.

I've been in crypto community (mostly Ethereum) for some time ([Mana Project](https://github.com/mana-ethereum), [Blockscout](https://github.com/poanetwork/blockscout)). I took a look at the Libra's teachnincal paper. I'll try to describe my thoughts on Libra comparing it with Ethereum in this blog post.

### Libra vs Ethereum

Let's compare some points described in the Libra's technical paper that I found important. Note, that I'll compare fundamental things without comparing technical details. Of cource, Libra tries to improve on Ethereum but so does Ethereum 2.0.
