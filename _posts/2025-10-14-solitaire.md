# 🎴 *Timeless Solitaire Collection* - A Calm Hobby Project About Classic Games

It’s been a while since my last update - I’ve been quietly experimenting, prototyping, and taking a small break from public posts.
But now it feels like the right moment to break the silence with something I’m genuinely excited about.

For the past few months, I’ve been working on a small **hobby project** called **Timeless Solitaire Collection** - a calm, modern reimagining of classic solitaire games.

What started as a side experiment turned into a focused design project about rhythm, patience, and polish.
I wanted to explore what makes Solitaire so enduring - the way a few simple rules can generate infinite variety - and present it in a clean, timeless way.

## 🃏 The Seven Solitaire Variants

Each game in *Timeless Solitaire Collection* has its own style, pacing, and strategic focus.
Some are inspired by classic solitaire rules, others are fresh twists with custom mechanics or themes.

### ♣ Magical Gathering *(Klondike variant)*

A reimagined take on Klondike with a gentle fantasy flavor - unique suits like crystals, skulls, potions, and pumpkins.
You can play with one to three decks, adjust draw counts, and toggle "Thoughtful Mode," which reveals all tableau cards for more strategic planning.
It’s the classic Solitaire experience, made smooth and modern.

### ♦ Club Calculus

A sleek, Art Deco-inspired calculation solitaire.
Instead of building by suit or color, you build sequences based on arithmetic progressions - a satisfying puzzle of timing and foresight.
The number of tableau piles (4, 5, or 6) can be adjusted to change the game’s difficulty.

---
### ♥ Age of Warriors *(FreeCell variant)*
![freecells](/images/2025-10-14-freecells.png)
A strategic, fully open solitaire where every card is visible from the start.
You can play with one or two decks and plan every move in advance.
It’s the most tactical variant in the collection - perfect for players who like long, deliberate sessions.

---
### ♠ Family Reunion *(Osmosis variant)*

A gothic-styled Osmosis solitaire that focuses on sequencing and memory.
It includes both Standard and Thoughtful modes, and lets you tweak how cards are dealt.
The rhythm of revealing and building here feels almost meditative once you get into the flow.

---
### 🌾 Farm Commotion *(Spider variant)*

A relaxed but challenging Spider solitaire set under a "restless night sky."
You can play with multiple decks and toggle between a colorful or black-and-white aesthetic.
There’s also a Thoughtful mode that reveals all tableau cards for a fairer, more strategic experience.

### 💀 Bad Habits *(Yukon variant)*

A playful Yukon solitaire inspired by vintage "rubber hose" cartoons.
All cards are visible, and you can configure stack rules - alternating colors, same suit, ascending, descending, and more.
It’s chaotic, expressive, and full of personality while keeping that classic logic core.

---
### 🐾 Zoo
A lighthearted twist on the genre - a memory-matching game where you flip cards to pair animals.
It supports solo and versus modes and adds a fun, casual break between traditional solitaire sessions.

---

## 🕊️ The Feel

The collection is designed to be quiet and focused - no ads, no clutter, just the cards and the motion.
The visuals are clean, the animations smooth, and every sound is soft and deliberate.

Each variant has its own aesthetic theme, but they all share the same atmosphere: calm, timeless, and satisfying.
