I think majority of people who extensively use note taking in their daily life and use notes to organize their lifes have heard about zettelkasten technique. The last couple of years it became very popular. I started diving into it on the new year's of eve (2020-2021), it can be verified by my tweet:

So I've been using it for three months so far. In this post I'll describe my experience and my routines around it. But before that let my quickly describe what zettelkasten is and why some people call it their second brain.

##  Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten (German: "slip box") is a note taking and knowledge management technique invented in the 15th Century. But it got relatively famous because of german sociologist  Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998) who used it extensively when writing more than 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles throughout his career. And Luhmann insisted that he was so productive because of Zettelkasten.

Zettelkasten has two basic rules:
1. Each note should contain a single idea, a peice of information
2. Notes are organized in a hierachical manner, i.e. notes reference each other

You may think that the idea of zettelkasten is simple. And you're right, it's simple and that's the beautty of it. It organizes information the same way our brain does: complex ideas are based on a lot of simple ideas which form a tree of ideas. Let me give an example. Imagine that you're trying to learn a new thing, for example, learn a new programming (or just a language) language:

1. Learn a new programming language
2. Read progamming books (1)
3. Notes on the book A (2)
4. Notes not the book B (2)
5. Write a simple project (1)
6. Notes for the project that you're writing (5)

Numbers after the points are refrences to another point. Now you have a plan for learning a language in zettlekasten way. Of cource, this example is deliberately too simple and convenicence of the zettelkasten can be seeen more clearer doing research work or studying. Other usages include:

- knowledge management
- writing (posts, books)
- organizing ideas when reading a book

## Tools

Before computers came to our life, people who used Zettelkasten where doing everything with peices of papers. But fortunately for us, we have some tools which we can use to easily create zettelkasten notes:

- Any issue tracker (trello, jira, notion etc) but each issue would contain a single idea. But in my humble opinion it seems like an overhead
- [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) - one of the most popular note taking zettelkasten tools
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - zettelkasten based on local markdown filed
- [Org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) - roam research clone for emacs


I use org-roam. So in the next section I'll describe it and my workflow using it.

## Org-roam

Disclaimer: using org-roam requires experience with emacs and org-mode so if you haven't used emacs I think org-roam may have a steep learning curve for you.

Org-roam stores all notes as org-mode files. Every note is assigned a unique timestamp which is used to refrence it in other notes. You can assign tags to a note. These takes are used to search note similar tags, also notes are searchable by name. Org-mode uses sqlite3 to index notes.

As zettelkasten itself, org-roam seemms very simple. All power of it comes from the fact that it uses org-mode for notes. Org-mode is one of the most powerful note-taking tools. You can find my more about org-mode in [my post](/2018/08/26/be-productive-with-org-mode/) I wrote a couple of years ago.

Another great feature of org-raom is ability to visualize connections between notes with graphs:

## Conclusion

I like zettelkasten way of taking notes more than common notes taking usual way with a set of organizaed notes because you have all your notes in the same place and they can be easily searched.
