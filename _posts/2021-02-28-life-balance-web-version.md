Around 1.5 years I released a mobile game called ["Life Balance"](https://thoughtkraken.com/life_balance) both for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thoughtkraken.lifebalance) and iOS. It's an endless runner game with a couple of twists:
- There are several bars to maintain (life, happiness, success, intelligence). They are unlocked as you progress through the game
- Some coins are positive for one bar and negative for another bar

Recently my Apple developer program expired so I decided to port the game to browsers so it can be played without native apps. It may seem like a simple game but it took me a long time to develop and launch it and I don't want my hard work go to waste.

The last couple of weekends I was porting the game to html5. The game engine I used (Godot) provides export to html5 but I discovered a couple of issues when testing it in the browser. Also, I fixed a couple of issues, removed ads and added music.

The game is available at [https://thoughtkraken.com/life_balance/play](https://thoughtkraken.com/life_balance/play). Enjoy!

It's also available on itch.io:
