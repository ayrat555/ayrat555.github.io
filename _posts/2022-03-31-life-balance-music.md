A couple of years ago I released a mobile game - [Life Balance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thoughtkraken.lifebalance&hl=en_US&gl=US).

Over the last weekend I decided to revisit it and played for a couple of hours. The game is actually fun!

The only thing that was missing for me was music. So I released an update which adds some lo-fi music.

Check the game out. Don't be fooled by colourful artwark, the game is very challenging.
