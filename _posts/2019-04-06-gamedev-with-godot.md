Every developer wants to make video games because video games are fun. But few developers try to create them. Why? Maybe it's because looking at triple A games it may seem impossible to create such tremendous high quality games. It's true you'll never create a game like the Witcher 3 with such a great amount of content alone. But I think modern game engines like Unity or Unreal allow developers to create beautiful games without high budgets and large teams.

Another thing that stops/slows down a developer is that most hardcore hackers want to create games from the ground up. It includes all lowlevel code like I/O, networking, rendering, animation, physics, audio etc. Yes, it's very interesting and it may be helpful to fully understand how everything works under the hood in other game engines. But it may take months/years before the engine will be finished and the work on game itself will be started. I fell into the same trap. Multiple times I was trying to work on a game engine but eventually I was abandoning the idea due to the shortage of time. I learned the Rust language to write fast lowlevel code for my engine. I mentioned it in my post called [In Rust I trust](https://www.badykov.com/rust/2018/01/28/in-rust-i-trust/).

### You don't have to invent the wheel

In the end of 2018 I decided that I should stop inventing the wheel. I started looking into different game engines and chose to go with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). Key factors that helped me to choose it:
- It's mature. The work on the project started in 2007,
- It's free and open source. Since I'm
- It has good documentation.
