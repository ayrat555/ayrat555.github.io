I'm not a smart contract developer but in my work I'v spent quite a lot of time reading smart contracts written in Solidty. I've spent even more time inspecting bytecodes generated by the Solidity programming language. The most frustrating thing for me working with Solidity is that there is no single place which describes all changes between different versions of Solidity. For all I know there are [documentations in the official Solidity repo](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/docs) describing deifferent part of the language but they are kept up to date only for the latest version of Solidity. So you're using not the latest version there is a possiblity that some features are cahnged in the latest version of Solidity and you have dig through CHANGELOG to find logic of theses features in your current version.

The reason that motivated me to write this post is metadata encoding in Solidity bytecode. It already changed two times in recent minor releases of Solidity but the bytecode [metadata documentation](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/metadata.rst) describes only the last version of Solidity (they didn't update it in the last release, I created [PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/metadata.rst) with update myself.

In this post I'll describe how metadata encoding changed in different version of Solidity. The information that described here is found mostly by trial and error inspecting bytecode and confirming guesses reading the Changelog of Solidty. If information is not full or it has errors, please suggest corrections and improvements.
