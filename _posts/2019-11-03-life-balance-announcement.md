### Life Balance

I've been working on the mobile game for a year already in my free time. The game is called "Life Balance". It's an endless runner game with a twist. From [its website](https://thoughtkraken.com/life_balance):

<blockquote>
  <p>
  In this game, you're going to balance life from infancy to old age of a single person represented by a cat.
  </p>
</blockquote>

You can find details about the game on the landing page I've made for it - [https://thoughtkraken.com/life_balance](https://thoughtkraken.com/life_balance)

I wasn't working on this game alone. I have a partner that made the same efforts as me to make it happen. This was a completely new experience for me. I'm planning to write about this in my future posts.

For now, I'd appreciate if you follow social pages of the game to get the word out:
