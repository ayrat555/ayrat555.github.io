After months of hard work we finally ported [our game](https://thoughtkraken.com/life_balance) to iOS and released it on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/life-balance/id1495840809?ls=1). Now iOS users can enjoy the endless adventure.

Our life is a series of bad and good days, failures and successes. Every day we have to balance between hard work and pleasure. That's why we are searching for a perfect work-life balance. "Life Balance" allows you to step into the role of a cat that tries to balance its life and become a complete person. This time you can make everything right!

Enjoy the life balance adventure, featuring:
- A new take on the endless runner game genre
- 4 life aspects that unlocked as you progress through your life cycle
- A couple of dozens of coins that represent different life activities
- Beautiful and colourful art
