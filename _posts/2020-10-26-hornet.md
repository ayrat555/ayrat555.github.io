### Motivation

Stress testing is a process of deliberately putting a system under intense load to test its stability. Stress testing can validate that a system can withstand expected stress, determine its limit and check its error handling capabilities.

Recently I wanted to stress test the project I'm working on. I checked existing load/stress testing libraries in the Elixir community. I found a couple of abandoned projects and one relatively well-maintained one - [Chaperon](https://github.com/polleverywhere/chaperon).

The scenario I wanted is to stress my system with constant operations per second (o/s) rate over multiple (12-24) hours. The chaperon library provides this feature with the [SpreadAsync](https://hexdocs.pm/chaperon/Chaperon.Action.SpreadAsync.html) module. From its docs, it does exactly what I want: "Action that calls a function with a given rate over a given interval of time (ms)". But after checking its [source code](https://github.com/polleverywhere/chaperon/blob/13cc4a2d2a7baacddf20c46397064b5e42a48d97/lib/chaperon/action/spread_async.ex), I found a flaw: it schedules a new process for each execution. For example, if you want to run a function with rate 3000 o/s over 20 hours, `chaperon` will start 3000 * 60 * 60 * 20 = 216_000_000 processes. If you run multiple stress tests or a single test with high o/s rate, VM machine just fails. If it does not fail, RAM usage increases over time and it may exhaust RAM completely on your machine (I think it happens because `chaperon` stores the result of each execution).

I decided to create a new library which would handle long-running stress tests more gracefully, spawning optimal number of processes. I called this library `Hornet`. In this post I'll describe its design.
